## Introduction
Hy there, I am Novri Anto. I was made this project for just a cloning project, and do some practices for myself, especially at uploading files using Node.js. I provided the main features of TikTok in this project, for example uploading a video, comment a video, following a user, etc.. . Well, feel free to get some contributions from you guys, I would really appreciate it!.

## Technologies
### 1. FrontEnd
In the FrontEnd side, I am using Next.js. That's because Next.js is awesome for me, and super easy to use it. Also, Next.js was good for SEO.

 - ### Run Next.js
    Type these in your command line:
    ```
    yarn dev
    ```
    or
    ```
    npm dev
    ```
For more further information, check ```./client```

### 2. BackEnd
In the Backend side, I am using Express.js. That's because Express.js is a small web framework to build RESTFull API, and it's super easy to use.

 - ### Run Express.js
    Type these in your command line:
    ```
    yarn dev
    ```
    or
    ```
    npm dev
    ```
For more further information, check ```./server```

## That's it
Hope you learn something new from this project. Happy Coding :)
